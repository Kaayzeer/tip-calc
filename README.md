## Layout

The designs were created to the following widths by order:

- Mobile: 375px

### Built with

- SASS
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop first
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I´ve learned about inmplementing SASS with a react application and the power
it comes with it. The dynamically strong css you can apply with SASS is very useful and I will deinitely continue my development in with theese tools.

I´ve also took the step to the open source community and hope to gain isight as well as hopefully contribute with anything to other members that might need it!.
